        "**Abstract**\n",
        "Automatic crack detection is a pivotal task in structural health monitoring and geoscience. We propose a \"universal\", training-free approach that robustly extracts crack networks across varying data distributions (e.g., concrete, rock, pavement). Our method generalizes the classical Frangi vesselness filter to the multi-modal setting, fusing photometric (intensity) and geometric (range/depth) data at the Hessian level. Instead of pixel-wise classification, we construct a sparse graph driven by a pairwise Frangi similarity metric, which rigorously encodes local tubular geometry. A novel topological extraction algorithm—combining Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering (HDBSCAN) and Weighted Betweenness Centrality on a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)—isolates the precise topological skeleton of the faults.\n",
